# BrickCode — Architecture

## Scale Convention

**1 world unit = 10 cm**

| Real-world measure | World units |
|--------------------|-------------|
| 1 stud (8 mm)      | 0.08        |
| Brick body height (9.6 mm) | 0.096 |
| Stud radius (2.4 mm) | 0.024    |
| Stud protrusion (1.8 mm) | 0.018 |

### Rationale

LEGO spec gives 1 stud = 8 mm. Expressing this literally as 0.008 world units creates two problems:

1. **Visibility** — the existing scene (20×20 floor, camera at `(0, 6, 10)`) would render bricks as sub-pixel specks.
2. **Rapier stability** — the physics engine is most stable for objects in the 0.1–10 unit range. Objects smaller than ~0.01 units risk jitter, tunneling, and sleeping artefacts.

Mapping 1 stud → 0.08 units (1 unit = 10 cm) puts a 2×4 brick at `0.16 × 0.096 × 0.32` units — comfortably in Rapier's stable range and clearly visible in the Three.js scene.

The constant `STUD = 0.08` lives in `LegoBrick.ts` and can be changed in one place if the scene scale changes later.

## Physics Collider Strategy

Studs (the cylindrical bumps on top of each brick) are **cosmetic only** — they appear in the Three.js mesh but are **not** part of the Rapier collider. Each brick uses a single `ColliderDesc.cuboid` matching the main body dimensions.

Why: including stud cylinders in the collider would make flat-top stacking fragile (bricks would balance on cylinder edges instead of resting flush). The visual studs communicate LEGO identity; the flat cuboid gives predictable, stable physics.

## Subsystem Responsibilities

| Subsystem | What it owns |
|-----------|--------------|
| `SimulationEngine` | Single `rAF` loop; steps Rapier then renders Three.js |
| `LegoBrick` | Holds one `THREE.Group` (body + studs) and one `RAPIER.RigidBody`; exposes `syncRender()` and `dispose()` |
| `Baseplate`             | 32×32 stud static platform; `RigidBodyDesc.fixed()` collider with top surface at y = 0; stud grid rendered via `DataTexture` (no DOM needed) |
| `LegoMotor` *(planned)* | Extends component pattern; adds `setSpeed()` driving a Rapier joint torque |
| `LegoSensor` *(planned)* | Rapier ray-cast each frame; exposes `readDistance()` |
| `BlockInterpreter` | Walks Blockly AST; calls component methods directly — no codegen |

## Baseplate

**File**: `src/engine/components/Baseplate.ts`

- Size: 32 × 32 studs = **2.56 × 2.56 world units**
- Thickness: 3.2 mm = **0.032 world units** (one LEGO plate height)
- Top surface is at **y = 0**; body centre at y = –0.016
- Physics: `RigidBodyDesc.fixed()` with a single `ColliderDesc.cuboid`
- Visual: `BoxGeometry` + `MeshStandardMaterial` with a `DataTexture` showing a 256 × 256 stud-circle grid (computed from raw pixel data — no canvas/DOM dependency, safe in Vitest/Node)
- Color: `#4CAF50` base, `#43A047` stud circles

> **Note**: `SceneSetup.ts` currently adds a separate decorative green floor plane at y = 0. When the Baseplate is used in the runtime scene, the floor in `SceneSetup` should be removed or repositioned to avoid z-fighting.
